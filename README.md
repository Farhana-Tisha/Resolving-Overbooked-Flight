# Resolving-Overbooked-Flight
This C++ code implements a flight booking system that manages passenger prioritization and ticket allocation. It prompts users to input passenger information such as name, mileage, years of frequent flying, and arrival position. Utilizing priority queues, the program calculates a priority value for each passenger based on their input data. Additionally, it considers the number of available seats to determine which passengers will receive tickets. The code then displays a waiting list of passengers in priority order and allocates tickets to the top-ranked passengers, resolving overbooked flights efficiently. Through its implementation of priority queues and stacks, this program offers a practical solution for managing flight reservations and ensuring a smooth booking process.
